Angular Assignment
Component 1 (q1_q2_navbar): Covers the implementation of a dynamic Navigation Menu with options (Home, Services, Contact Us), where the selected menu item highlights and displays the chosen menu text.
Q2 in q1_q2_navbar: Demonstrates the use of the NgStyle directive to apply conditional styles such as background color change on menu selection.
Component 2 (q3_binding): Implements two-way data binding where the user enters a name, and it is displayed below. If the name "Abhijit" is entered, the text color changes to green.
Project Setup: Run ng serve to start the project and view the components.
Both components demonstrate essential Angular concepts including data binding and conditional styling.
